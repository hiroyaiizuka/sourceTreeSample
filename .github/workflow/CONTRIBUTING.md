## Why Guideline?

While code review is recognized as a valuable tool for improving the quality of software projects, code review comments that are perceived as being unclear or harsh can have unfavorable consequences: slow reviews, blocked dependent code reviews, negative emotions, or negative perceptions of other contributors or colleagues

## Reviewer

- **Provide specific and actionable feedback.**

If you don’t have specific advice, sometimes it’s helpful to ask for clarification on why the author made a decision.

- **Do not criticize person.**

Instead, discuss the code.

- **Do not use harsh language.**

Code review comments with a negative tone are less likely to be useful.

- **Consider how comments may be interpreted.**

Be mindful of the differing ways hyperbole, jokes, and emojis may be perceived.

## Reviewee

- **Code changes should be less than 500 lines.**

If changes are big, seperate into a few branches.

- **Reviewee should ask Reviewer before to merge the branch.**

Do not merge or close without reviewer permission.

- **Clarify code or reply to the reviewer’s comment in response to feedback.**

Do not choose fixes by reviewee own judge.

Failing to do so can signal a lack of receptiveness to implementing improvements to the code.

- **When disagreeing with feedback, explain the advantage of your approach.**
