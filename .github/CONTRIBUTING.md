# Guidline

While code review is recognized as a valuable tool for improving the quality of software projects, code review comments that are perceived as being unclear or harsh can have unfavorable consequences: slow reviews, blocked dependent code reviews, negative emotions, or negative perceptions of other contributors or colleagues.

# Reviewer

## Provide specific and actionable feedback.

- If you don’t have specific advice, sometimes it’s helpful to ask for clarification on why the author made a decision.

## Do not criticize person

- Instead, discuss the code.

## Do not use harsh language

- Code review comments with a negative tone are less likely to be useful.

## Consider how comments may be interpreted.

- Be mindful of the differing ways hyperbole, jokes, and emojis may be perceived.

# Reviewee

## Code changes should be less than 500 lines.

- If changes are big, seperate into a few branches.

## Reviewee should ask Reviewer before to merge the branch.

- Do not merge or close without reviewer permission.

## Clarify code or reply to the reviewer’s comment in response to feedback.

- Do not choose fixes by reviewee own judge.
- Failing to do so can signal a lack of receptiveness to implementing improvements to the code.

## When disagreeing with feedback, explain the advantage of your approach.
